-?	Need to detect Zhonas

Optimize object maintenance cycle. This _seems_ to be the biggest source of performance issues.
	- I've added an early abort for some common objects that I don't think I care about. (minions, minion attacks etc)
	- I might add an early abort if an object is processed. E.g. if an object is a creep there's no need to check if it's a buff also.
