-?	Need to detect Zhonas

Optimize object maintenance cycle. This _seems_ to be the biggest source of performance issues.
	- I've added an early abort for some common objects that I don't think I care about. (minions, minion attacks etc)
	- I might add an early abort if an object is processed. E.g. if an object is a creep there's no need to check if it's a buff also.


My disrupt and prediction stuff is pretty spread out and confusing.
	I should be able to detect invulnerablity by spell as well as by object. By spell should be WAY more reliable but doesn't work if I don't see the cast.
		I don't need to find and process the zhonya's object and pair it with a player. If I see them use the item I know how long it lasts etc. The risk of not seeing them use invuln seems low as why would they use it if noone can see them.

Fix ward detection to get rid of obsolete wards.
	If I don't see something trigger it won't auto clear. I don't know the fix for this but I need a fix for this.

Change GetSkillShot to take a "purpose" to prefer higher chance hit or weaker targets.

Code up smite champs if I have the item

Code up being oathbound to kalista

I don't like having to hold the button for jungle. especially for melee toons. I'd like to start the jungle and have it auto jungle until the camp is dead or I'm out of range or I cancel it or something.
